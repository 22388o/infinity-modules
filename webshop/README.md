webshop
=======

A template for a basic module that allows one to register items, optionally set up notifications via webhook or Telegram messages, and generates a webpage for potential buyers to browser through the products and buy them with Lightning.

Here's a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixuL68Mbp94) that also explains the internals of the code:

This code is intended to be forked and modified, if you need more or different options and want a different UI for the buyer side.

To use it as it is use `https://mod.fiatjaf.com/webshop/webshop.lua`, or use http://githack.com to get an URL to a specific commit that won't change later.
